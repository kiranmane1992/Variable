        // we can declare varible by three types
        //1.1et-we can not dclare varibale many time but we can assign other value
        //2.var-we can declare varible many time
        //3.cont-once value declare we can not assign other value to same varible




         let A = "hello world";//If same string used everywhere and you want to change is at once at every place that tile varibles usefull
         A="I am learning javascript variable"// once varibale is decleared we can use that varibale dirctly to give value
         var B=100
         document.write(A);//A is varibles. If variable is a number then no need to give qoute
         document.write(B)
